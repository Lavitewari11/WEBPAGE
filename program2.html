    <dd><p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the
         fundamental language used to create and structure web pages. It uses "tags" to define content like paragraphs, headings, images, and links, which web browsers interpret and 
         display to the user. HTML provides the skeleton or structure of a webpage, with styling and interactivity typically added by other languages like CSS and JavaScript.  </p>
